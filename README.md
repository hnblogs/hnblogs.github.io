Add Your Website
----------------

### Criteria

Please check whether a website meets **all** of the following criteria
before requesting its inclusion in the directory:

 1. **Personal Website**

    The website must be a personal website.  It should not be a
    company website or a community website.  The website should belong
    to an individual.

 2. **Author-Controlled Website**

    The website must be a personal website where the author has full
    control over its design, content and presentation.  This includes
    control over layout, styling and monetisation.  Websites hosted on
    platforms that inject advertisements, branding or other third
    party content do not meet this criterion.  Similarly, websites on
    platforms that limit the author's control over design or
    presentation in any way do not qualify.

    Websites hosted on personal domains clearly qualify.  Websites
    hosted on services such as Neocities, GitHub Pages or Codeberg
    Pages also qualify, as these platforms allow full control over the
    site's design.  However, blogs hosted on publishing platforms such
    as Medium, Substack or the free WordPress.com service do not
    qualify.

    Note: This requirement is about control, not quality.  Many
    excellent blogs fall outside the scope of this directory.

 2. **Substantive Personal Content**

    The website must contain substantive content such as articles,
    blog posts, projects or games developed by the author.  Websites
    that consist only of a CV or portfolio are not suitable for
    inclusion in this directory.  This requirement helps keep the
    directory interesting and meaningful, and prevents it from
    becoming a collection of minimal or placeholder websites with
    little value to the community.


### Add via PR

Add the website details to [pwd.lisp][lisp] and submit a pull request.

An example entry is provided at the bottom of the [pwd.lisp][lisp]
file and can be copied and modified as a starting point.  When
creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

 1. Keep all website entries sorted alphabetically by name.

 2. Write the bio text in the third person.  That is, do not write:

    ```
    I write about functional programming.
    ```

    Instead, write about:

    ```
    Writes about functional programming.
    ```

    The intention is to reflect that the curators are adding your
    website to this project.  Although you are the one authoring the
    pull request, it is intended to help the curators include your
    website more quickly.  Therefore, the language should match what
    the curators would have written if they were adding the website
    themselves.

 3. Ensure that the bio text does not exceed 80 characters.

 4. End the bio text with a full stop (period).

 5. Do not use ampersand ('&') in the bio text.  Write the word 'and'
    instead.

 6. Do not use Oxford comma (serial comma) in the bio text.  That is,
    do not write:

    ```
    Writes about C, C++, and Go.
    ```

    Instead, write:

    ```
    Writes about C, C++ and Go.
    ```

 7. Separate two sentences by double spaces.  That is, do not write:

    ```
    Game developer. Writes about computer graphics.
    ```

    Instead, write:

    ```
    Game developer.  Writes about computer graphics.
    ```

 8. Begin URLs with `http://` or `https://`.

 9. If a URL points to the root directory, include the trailing slash.
    For example, write `https://example.com/` (not
    `https://example.com`).  This avoids an extra redirect for many
    clients.

10. If certain information is not available or should not be included,
    remove the corresponding property entirely.  For example, if no
    'about' link exists, delete the entire `:about` line from the
    entry.

While we recommend that you follow these guidelines, do not worry too
much about getting everything right on the first attempt.  Automated
checks run on every pull request and if you miss something, the
failing checks will tell you what needs fixing.

Aside: The 4th (no Oxford comma) and 5th points above (double spacing
convention) are likely going to feel awkward to many people.  This
project uses British English (BrE) and Oxford comma is generally not
used in BrE.  Further, the original author of this project uses Emacs
and has configured it to follow the rather old convention of
separating sentences with double spaces.  As a result, we require
sentences to be separated by double spaces here as well.  Yes, you
lose some precious bytes for your 80 character bio.  Consider it the
price you pay for including your website in this directory.


### Add via Issue

If creating a pull request is too much hassle for you, submit your
website by creating an issue.  You can do this by following this link:
[new-site][].

While creating the issue, do follow all the guidelines mentioned in
the previous section.

FAQ
---

 1. How is this different from the OPML available at
    [outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs][outcoldman]?

    The OPML file there is more comprehensive.  It currently includes
    over 1200 RSS feeds, whereas our project only has a small number
    of entries so far.  We hope that, with contributions from
    community members, our list will grow over time.  An important
    goal of this project is to maintain the list of websites together
    as a community.

    This project also goes beyond providing an OPML file.  In addition
    to the [OPML][opml], it offers a [website][site] that lists the
    websites individually along with a short bio of each author.

 2. Why did you not start by importing
    [outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs][outcoldman]?

    We have not yet had the time to do so.  The [data format][lisp]
    used by this project differs from theirs and requires additional
    information for each blog entry.  Translating the existing list
    into our format therefore takes a non-trivial amount of effort,
    which we have not been able to commit to yet.

    Contributions that add entries to this project, whether sourced
    from that list or elsewhere, are very welcome.

 3. I posted my website to your [megathread on HN][hnt].  Why is it
    not added to the directory yet?

    We received over 2000 website suggestions on that thread. Each
    submission requires a brief visual review to ensure it is a good
    fit for this directory, and this process cannot be fully
    automated.  As a result, it is likely to take several months to
    work through all the suggestions we received.

    To track our progress, you can follow our backlog here:
    [repo][backlog-repo], [table][backlog-table].

 4. Can I contribute my time and help you make progress faster?

    Yes, certainly. Currently, we are only two people working through
    the backlog. If you would like to help, please join us in our IRC
    channel [#hnpwd][IRC]. You may need to stay connected for a while
    after asking, as not all volunteers are present at all hours of
    the day.
